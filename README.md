# Project Title
EasyShop Project

## Description of the Project
This project is an e-commerce platform with a Spring Boot API backend and a MySQL database. It enables users to register, 
log in, browse products across various categories, and filter them by price range and color. The backend also provides functionalities for admins to manage categories and products,
including adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting categories and products. The project focuses on fixing existing bugs, implementing new features,
and ensuring smooth backend operations to support the front-end functionality and enhance the overall user experience.
